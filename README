I.    ABOUT

      This module started back in September of 2004 because I was tired of
      trying to fix bugs in mod_ssl.  mod_ssl is a giant beast of a module --
      no offense to it's authors is intended -- but I believe it has fallen
      prey to massive feature bloat.

      When I started hacking on httpd, mod_ssl remained a great mystery to me,
      and when I actually looked at it, I ran away.  The shear amount code is
      huge, and it does not conform to the style guidelines.  It was painful to
      read, and even harder to debug.  I wanted to understand how it worked,
      and I had recently heard about GnuTLS, so long story short, I decided to
      implement a mod_gnutls.

         Lines of Code in mod_ssl: 15,324
         Lines of Code in mod_gnutls: 3,594

      Because of writing mod_gnutls, I now understand how input and output
      filters work, better than I ever thought possible.  It was a little
      painful at times, and some parts lift code and ideas directly from
      mod_ssl.  Kudos to the original authors of mod_ssl.

IV.   STATUS

      * SSL and TLS connections with all popular browsers work!
      * Sets environmental vars for scripts (compatible with mod_ssl vars)
      * Supports memcached as a distributed SSL session cache
      * Supports DBM as a local SSL session cache
      * Support for server name indication (SNI), RFC3546
      * Support for client certificates
      * Support for secure remote password (SRP), RFC5054



V.    BASIC CONFIGURATION

      LoadModule gnutls_module modules/mod_gnutls.so
      
      # mod_gnutls can optionally use a memcached server to store it's SSL
      # Sessions.  This is useful in a cluster environment, where you want all
      # of your servers to share a single SSL session cache.
      #GnuTLSCache memcache "127.0.0.1 server2.example.com server3.example.com"
      
      # The Default method is to use a DBM backed Cache.  It isn't super fast,
      # but it is portable and does not require another server to be running
      # like memcached.

VI.   CREATE OPENPGP CREDENTIALS FOR THE SERVER

      mod_gnutls currently cannot read encrypted OpenPGP credentials.  That is,
      when you generate a key with gpg and gpg prompts you for a passphrase,
      just press enter.  Then press enter again, to confirm an empty
      passphrase.  http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.outoforder.modules

      These instructions are from the GnuTLS manual:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/manual/html_node/Invoking-gnutls_002dserv.html#Invoking-gnutls_002dserv

        $ gpg --gen-key
        ...enter whatever details you want, use 'test.gnutls.org' as name...

      Make a note of the OpenPGP key identifier of the newly generated key,
      here it was 5D1D14D8.  You will need to export the key for GnuTLS to be
      able to use it.

         $ gpg -a --export 5D1D14D8 > openpgp-server.txt
         $ gpg -a --export-secret-keys 5D1D14D8 > openpgp-server-key.txt
