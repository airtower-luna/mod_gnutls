** Version 0.4.2

- Added support for sending a certificate chain.

- Corrected bug which did not allow the TLS session cache to be used.

** Version 0.4.1 (2007-12-03)

- Added support for subject alternative names in certificates.
Only one per certificate is supported.

- New enviroment variables: SSL_CLIENT_M_VERSION, SSL_CLIENT_S_SAN%, 
SSL_CLIENT_S_TYPE, SSL_SERVER_M_VERSION, SSL_SERVER_S_SAN%, SSL_SERVER_S_TYPE

- The compatibility mode can now be enabled explicitely with the
%COMPAT keyword at the GnuTLSPriorities string. It is no longer the default.

- Check for GnuTLSPriorities directive. This corrects a segfault. Thanks
to David Hrbáč.

- Better handling of GnuTLSDHFile and GnuTLSRSAFile.

- No longer default paths for RSA and DH parameter files.
