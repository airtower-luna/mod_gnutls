** Version 0.5.9 (unreleased)
- Corrected behavior in Keep-Alive connections (do not
  terminate the connection prematurely)

- The GnuTLSCache variable now can be given the specific
  option "sdbm" instead of "dbm". "dbm" will use the default
  dbm type of libapr while sdbm will force sdbm to be used.

** Version 0.5.8 (2010-08-18)
- Session tickets are enabled by default.

- Fixes some segmentation faults noticed in some
  configurations.

** Version 0.5.7 (2010-07-01)
- Force usage of SDBM. For some reason the default in
  my system had issues after reaching a limit of entries.
  SDBM seems stable so force it.

- Optimizations in session caching.

- Added support for session tickets. This allows a
  server to avoid using a session cache and still support
  session resumption. This is at the cost of transporting
  session data during handshake. New option
  GnuTLSSessionTickets [on|off]

- Depend on gnutls 2.10.0 to force support for safe
  renegotiation.

** Version 0.5.6 (2010-03-24)
- Corrected issue with firefox and long POST data (by
  handling EINTR and EAGAIN errors in read).

- Added support for chained client certificates

- Corrected more issues related to double frees

** Version 0.5.5 (2009-06-13)

- Removed limits on CA certificate loading. Reported by
  Sander Marechal and Jack Bates.

- Do not allow sending empty TLS packets even when instructed to.
  This had the side effect of clients closing connection.

** Version 0.5.4 (2009-01-04)

- mod_gnutls.h: modified definition to extern to avoid compilation
  errors in darwin.

- Added patch to fix issue with mod_proxy. Investigation and patch by Alain
  Knaff.

- libgnutls detection uses pkg-config.

** Version 0.5.3 (2008-10-16)

- Corrected bug to allow having an OpenPGP-only web site.

- Increased Max handshake tries due to interrupted system calls.

** Version 0.5.2 (2008-06-29)

- Depend on gnutls 2.4 which has openpgp support in main library.

** Version 0.5.1 (2008-03-05)

- Added --disable-srp configure option

- Better check for memcache (patch by Guillaume Rousse)

- Corrected possible memory leak in DBM support for resuming sessions.

** Version 0.5.0-alpha (2008-01-24)

- Added support for OpenPGP keys. The new directives are:
  GnuTLSPGPKeyringFile, GnuTLSPGPCertificateFile, GnuTLSPGPKeyFile

** Version 0.4.2 (2007-12-10)

- Added support for sending a certificate chain.

- Corrected bug which did not allow the TLS session cache to be used.

- Do not allow resuming sessions on different servers.

** Version 0.4.1 (2007-12-03)

- Added support for subject alternative names in certificates.
Only one per certificate is supported.

- New enviroment variables: SSL_CLIENT_M_VERSION, SSL_CLIENT_S_SAN%, 
SSL_CLIENT_S_TYPE, SSL_SERVER_M_VERSION, SSL_SERVER_S_SAN%, SSL_SERVER_S_TYPE

- The compatibility mode can now be enabled explicitely with the
%COMPAT keyword at the GnuTLSPriorities string. It is no longer the default.

- Check for GnuTLSPriorities directive. This corrects a segfault. Thanks
to David Hrbáč.

- Better handling of GnuTLSDHFile and GnuTLSRSAFile.

- No longer default paths for RSA and DH parameter files.
