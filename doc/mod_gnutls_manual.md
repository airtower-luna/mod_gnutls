`mod_gnutls` is a module for the Apache web server that provides HTTPS
(HTTP over Transport Layer Security (TLS)) using the GnuTLS library.
More information about the module can be found at
[the project's website](https://github.com/airtower-luna/mod_gnutls).

* * * * *

Compilation & Installation
==========================

`mod_gnutls` uses [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) to run build and
tests, see the project options section in `meson configure` (or read
`meson.options` in the source). Usually build & install commands will
look smilar to this, with `build/` as the build directory:

```sh
meson setup build
meson compile -C build/
meson test -C build/
meson install -C build/
```

* * * * *

Integration
===========

To activate `mod_gnutls` just add the following line to your httpd.conf
and restart Apache:

    LoadModule gnutls_module modules/mod_gnutls.so

Module Dependencies
-------------------

`mod_gnutls` uses the Apache HTTPD [Shared Object
Cache](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/socache.html) to cache
[OCSP responses for OCSP stapling](#gnutlsocspcache) and [TLS
sessions](#gnutlscache). To use either cache you need to load a
suitable `mod_socache_PROVIDER` module, which should be provided by
your Apache installation.

It is recommended to load at least `mod_socache_shmcb`. If that module
is loaded `mod_gnutls` will [enable OCSP stapling by
default](#gnutlsocspstapling), without needing any further
configuration other than a [certificate chain](#gnutlscertificatefile)
with OCSP support.

* * * * *

Configuration Directives
========================

General Options
---------------

### GnuTLSEnable

Enable GnuTLS for this virtual host

    GnuTLSEnable [on|off]

Default: *off*\
Context: virtual host

This directive enables SSL/TLS Encryption for a Virtual Host.

### GnuTLSCache

Configure TLS Session Cache

    GnuTLSCache (shmcb|dbm|memcache|...|none)[:PARAMETERS]

Default: `GnuTLSCache none`\
Context: server config

This directive configures the TLS session cache for `mod_gnutls`. The
TLS session cache is used both as a server side session cache if not
using session tickets (for TLS 1.2 and earlier), and if `mod_gnutls`
is configured as a HTTPS reverse proxy also to cache client sessions
to backend servers (for TLS 1.3 only).

A cache accessed over network (e.g. memcache) may be shared between
machines of different architectures. If the selected cache
implementation is not thread-safe, access is serialized using the
`gnutls-cache` mutex.

Which cache implementations are available depends on your Apache
installation and configuration, `mod_gnutls` can use any socache
provider. In general you will need to load a `mod_socache_PROVIDER`
module. Common options are described below, please check the Apache
HTTPD documentation for details on available providers and their
configuration.

`shmcb`
:   Uses a shared memory segment. This is a high performance local
    cache. The parameter is a relative or absolute path to be used if
    the local shared memory implementation requires one, followed by
    the cache size in bytes enclosed in parentheses.

    Example: `shmcb:cache/gnutls_cache(65536)`

`dbm`
:   Uses a DBM cache file. The parameter is a relative or absolute
    path to be used as the DBM cache file. Note that the dbm cache has
    a size limitation for entries that is too small for OCSP responses
    or proxy session data.

    Example: `dbm:cache/gnutls_cache`

`memcache`
:   Uses memcached server(s) to cache TLS session data. The parameter
    is a comma separated list of servers (host:port). This can be used
    to share a session cache between all servers in a cluster.

    Example: `memcache:memcache.example.com:12345,memcache2.example.com:12345`

`none`
:   Turns off all caching of TLS sessions.

    This can reduce the performance of `mod_gnutls` since every
    followup connection by a client must perform a full TLS
    handshake. This is the default because it requires no
    configuration.

    Session tickets are an alternative to using a session cache,
    please see `GnuTLSSessionTickets`. Note that for TLS 1.3 GnuTLS
    supports resumption using session tickets only as of version
    3.6.4.

### GnuTLSCacheTimeout

Timeout for TLS Session Cache expiration

    GnuTLSCacheTimeout SECONDS

Default: `GnuTLSCacheTimeout 300`\
Context: server config, virtual host

Sets the expiration timeout for cached TLS sessions.

### GnuTLSSessionTickets

Enable Session Tickets for the server

    GnuTLSSessionTickets [on|off]

Default: `off`
Context: server config, virtual host

Session tickets allow TLS session resumption without session state
stored on the server, using encrypted tickets provided to the clients
instead. Tickets are an alternative to using a session cache, and
currently the only session resumption mechanism in TLS 1.3. For a pool
of servers this option is not recommended since the tickets are bound
to the issuing server only.

If this option is set in the global configuration, virtual hosts
without a `GnuTLSSessionTickets` setting will use the global setting.

*Warning:* The primary key used to encrypt the tickets is generated
while the server loads its configuration. An attacker who is able to
read this key from server RAM may be able to decrypt past TLS 1.2
sessions and impersonate the server to clients trying to resume
sessions using tickets. If you enable session tickets you should
regularly `reload` the server to generate fresh keys. Many
distributions automatically do this during log rotation.

### GnuTLSDHFile

Use the provided PKCS \#3 encoded Diffie-Hellman parameters

    GnuTLSDHFile FILEPATH

Default: *none*\
Context: server config, virtual host

By default `mod_gnutls` uses the DH parameters included with GnuTLS
corresponding to the security level of the configured private keys.

If you need to use different DH parameters, you can provide a PEM file
containing them in PKCS \#3 encoding using this option. Please see the
"[Parameter
generation](https://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Parameter-generation.html)"
section of the GnuTLS documentation for a short discussion of the
security implications. Note that to use a custom group for DHE you
must also explicitly disable [RFC
7919](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7919) group negotiation using
[`GnuTLSPriorities`](#gnutlspriorities).

### GnuTLSPriorities

Set the allowed protocol versions, ciphers, key exchange algorithms,
MACs and compression methods

    GnuTLSPriorities NORMAL:+CIPHER_0:-CIPHER_1:...:+CIPHER_N

Default: `NORMAL:-RSA:-VERS-TLS1.0:-VERS-TLS1.1`\
Context: server config, virtual host

Sets the allowed protocol version(s), ciphers, key exchange methods,
message authentication codes, and other TLS parameters for the server.
The parameter is a GnuTLS priority string as described in the
[the GnuTLS documentation](https://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Priority-Strings.html).

Plain RSA, without (EC-)DH, is disabled by default because it doesn't
provide forward secrecy, TLS 1.0 and 1.1 have been deprecated as
insecure for a long time and are now disabled in most modern web
browsers.

### GnuTLSP11Module

Load this PKCS #11 module.

    GnuTLSP11Module PATH_TO_LIBRARY

Default: *none*\
Context: server config

Load this PKCS #11 provider module, instead of the system
defaults. May occur multiple times to load multiple modules.

### GnuTLSPIN

Set the PIN to be used to access encrypted key files or PKCS #11 objects.

    GnuTLSPIN XXXXXX

Default: *none*\
Context: server config, virtual host

Takes a string to be used as a PIN for the protected objects in
a security module, or as a key to be used to decrypt PKCS #8, PKCS #12,
or openssl encrypted keys.

### GnuTLSSRKPIN

Set the SRK PIN to be used to access the TPM.

    GnuTLSSRKPIN XXXXXX

Default: *none*\
Context: server config, virtual host

Takes a string to be used as a PIN for the protected objects in
the TPM module.

### GnuTLSExportCertificates

Export the PEM encoded certificates to CGIs

    GnuTLSExportCertificates [off|on|SIZE]

Default: `off`\
Context: server config, virtual host

This directive configures exporting the full certificates of the
server and the client to CGI scripts via the `SSL_SERVER_CERT` and
`SSL_CLIENT_CERT` environment variables. The exported certificates
will be PEM-encoded, limited to the given size. The type of the
certificate will be exported in `SSL_SERVER_CERT_TYPE` and
`SSL_CLIENT_CERT_TYPE`.

SIZE should be an integer number of bytes, or may be written with a
trailing `K` to indicate kibibytes.  `off` means the same thing as
`0`, in which case the certificates will not be exported to the
environment. `on` is an alias for `16K`. If a non-zero size is
specified for this directive, but a certificate is too large to fit in
the buffer, then the corresponding environment variable will contain
the fixed string `GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_SIZE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`.

With GnuTLSExportCertificates enabled, `mod_gnutls` exports the same
environment variables to the CGI process as `mod_ssl`.

X.509 Certificate Authentication
--------------------------------

### GnuTLSCertificateFile

Set the PEM encoded server certificate or certificate chain

    GnuTLSCertificateFile FILEPATH

Default: *none*\
Context: server config, virtual host

FILEPATH is an absolute or relative path to a file containing the
PEM-encoded X.509 certificate to use as this Server's End Entity (EE)
certificate, and optionally those of the issuing Certificate
Authorities (CAs). If the file contains multiple certificates they
must be ordered from EE to the CA closest to the root CA.

Including the full certificate chain is highly recommended because the
CA certificates are needed for [OCSP stapling](#ocsp-stapling-configuration).

Since version 0.7 this can be a PKCS #11 URL instead of a file.

On Linux and other Unix-like systems you can create the file with a
command like this (assuming "CA 1" issued the server certificate and
has been issued by "Root CA" itself):

	$ cat server.pem ca-1.pem root-ca.pem >server-chain.pem

### GnuTLSKeyFile

Set to the PEM Encoded Server Private Key

    GnuTLSKeyFile FILEPATH

Default: *none*\
Context: server config, virtual host

Takes an absolute or relative path to the Server Private Key. Set
`GnuTLSPIN` if the key file is encrypted.

Since version 0.7 this can be a PKCS #11 URL.

**Security Warning:**\
This private key must be protected. It is read while Apache is still
running as root, and does not need to be readable by the nobody or
apache user.

### GnuTLSClientVerify

Enable client certificate verification

    GnuTLSClientVerify [ignore|request|require]

Default: `ignore`\
Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess

This directive controls if clients need to authenticate with a
certificate to access resources. If a mode other than `ignore` is used
in a directory context the server may request post-handshake
authentication (TLS 1.3 only, see below). Trusted CAs for certificate
validation are set using [`GnuTLSClientCAFile`](#gnutlsclientcafile).

`ignore`
:   `mod_gnutls` will not request certificates from clients, and allow
    any requests.

`request`
:   Client certificates will be requested, but requests are still
    allowed if the client does not send one or the provided
    certificate is invalid. If the client authenticates, the
    certificate validation status will be stored in the
    [`SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY`](#ssl_client_verify) environment variable and
    can be `SUCCESS`, `FAILED` or `NONE`.

`require`
:   Client certificate authentication will be required for access. If
    set at server or virtual host level TLS connections from clients
    without a valid certificate will be denied. If set at directory
    level any requests without a valid client certificate will be
    denied with a 403 Forbidden error. The `SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY`
    environment variable will be set to `SUCCESS` if access is
    allowed, additional [environment
    variables](#environment-variables) will hold details on the client
    certificate.

When using TLS 1.3 `mod_gnutls` will request [post-handshake
authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-4.6.2) as
necessary if the client announced support during the handshake. With
TLS versions 1.2 and earlier `mod_gnutls` supports client
authentication only during the initial handshake.

If you want clients that do not support TLS 1.3 at all or do not
support the post-handshake authentication extension to have access to
resources that require authentication, you can set `GnuTLSClientVerify
request` at the server or virtual host level so clients can
authenticate during the initial handshake.

### GnuTLSClientCAFile

Set the PEM encoded Certificate Authority list to use for X.509 base
client authentication

    GnuTLSClientCAFile FILEPATH

Default: *none*
Context: server config, virtual host

Takes an absolute or relative path to a PEM Encoded Certificate to use
as a Certificate Authority with Client Certificate Authentication.
This file may contain a list of trusted authorities.

SRP Authentication
------------------

### GnuTLSSRPPasswdFile

Set to the SRP password file for SRP ciphersuites

    GnuTLSSRPPasswdFile FILEPATH

Default: *none*\
Context: server config, virtual host

Takes an absolute or relative path to an SRP password file. This is
the same format as used in libsrp.  You can generate such file using
the command `srptool --passwd /etc/tpasswd --passwd-conf
/etc/tpasswd.conf -u test` to set a password for user test.  This
password file holds the username, a password verifier and the
dependency to the SRP parameters.

### GnuTLSSRPPasswdConfFile

Set to the SRP password.conf file for SRP ciphersuites

    GnuTLSSRPPasswdConfFile FILEPATH

Default: *none*\
Context: server config, virtual host

Takes an absolute or relative path to an SRP password.conf file. This
is the same format as used in `libsrp`.  You can generate such file
using the command `srptool --create-conf /etc/tpasswd.conf`.  This
file holds the SRP parameters and is associate with the password file
(the verifiers depends on these parameters).

TLS Proxy Configuration
-----------------------

### GnuTLSProxyEngine

Enable TLS proxy connections for this virtual host

    GnuTLSProxyEngine [on|off]

Default: *off*\
Context: virtual host

This directive enables support for TLS proxy connections for a virtual
host.

### GnuTLSProxyCAFile

Set to the PEM encoded Certificate Authority Certificate

    GnuTLSProxyCAFile FILEPATH

Default: *none*\
Context: server config, virtual host

Takes an absolute or relative path to a PEM encoded certificate to use
as a Certificate Authority when verifying certificates provided by
proxy back end servers. This file may contain a list of trusted
authorities. If not set, verification of TLS back end servers will
always fail due to lack of a trusted CA.

### GnuTLSProxyCRLFile

Set to the PEM encoded Certificate Revocation List

    GnuTLSProxyCRLFile FILEPATH

Default: *none*\
Context: server config, virtual host

Takes an absolute or relative path to a PEM encoded Certificate
Revocation List to use when verifying certificates provided by proxy
back end servers. The file may contain a list of CRLs.

### GnuTLSProxyCertificateFile

Set to the PEM encoded Client Certificate

    GnuTLSProxyCertificateFile FILEPATH

Default: *none*\
Context: server config, virtual host

Takes an absolute or relative path to a PEM encoded X.509 certificate
to use as this Server's End Entity (EE) client certificate for TLS
client authentication in proxy TLS connections. If you need to supply
certificates for intermediate Certificate Authorities (iCAs), they
should be listed in sequence in the file, from EE to the iCA closest
to the root CA. Optionally, you can also include the root CA's
certificate as the last certificate in the list.

If not set, TLS client authentication will be disabled for TLS proxy
connections. If set, `GnuTLSProxyKeyFile` must be set as well to
provide the matching private key.

### GnuTLSProxyKeyFile

Set to the PEM encoded Private Key

    GnuTLSProxyKeyFile FILEPATH

Default: *none*\
Context: server config, virtual host

Takes an absolute or relative path to the Private Key matching the
certificate configured using the `GnuTLSProxyCertificateFile`
directive. This key cannot currently be password protected.

**Security Warning:**\
This private key must be protected. It is read while Apache is still
running as root, and does not need to be readable by the nobody or
apache user.

### GnuTLSProxyPriorities

Set the allowed ciphers, key exchange algorithms, MACs and compression
methods for proxy connections

    GnuTLSProxyPriorities NORMAL:+CIPHER_0:-CIPHER_1:...:+CIPHER_N

Default: `NORMAL:-RSA:-VERS-TLS1.0:-VERS-TLS1.1`\
Context: server config, virtual host

Sets the allowed protocol version(s), ciphers, key exchange methods,
message authentication codes, and other TLS parameters for TLS proxy
connections. Like for `GnuTLSPriorities` the parameter is a GnuTLS
priority string as described in the
[the GnuTLS documentation](https://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Priority-Strings.html).

OCSP Stapling Configuration
---------------------------

OCSP stapling, formally known as the TLS Certificate Status Request
extension, allows the server to provide the client with a cached OCSP
response for its certificate during the handshake. With OCSP stapling
the client does not have to send an OCSP request to the issuer CA to
check the certificate status, which offers privacy and performance
advantages, and avoids the security issue of how to handle errors that
prevent the client from getting a response.

With TLS 1.2 stapling can be used only for the server certificate.
TLS 1.3 supports stapling for all transmitted certificates.
Mod\_gnutls will staple for as many consecutive certificates in the
certificate chain as possible, ideally all except the root CA.

Mod\_gnutls enables OCSP stapling by default if possible. The following
requirements must be met:

* OCSP responses are verified using the issuer CAs of the certificates
  being checked, so the CAs must be included in
  [`GnuTLSCertificateFile`](#gnutlscertificatefile). Providing the
  whole certificate chain (including the root CA) is recommended.

* Mod\_gnutls needs a cache to store OCSP responses for stapling. If
  [mod\_socache\_shmcb](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/mod/mod_socache_shmcb.html)
  is loaded mod\_gnutls can set up the cache without additional
  configuration, for other options see
  [`GnuTLSOCSPCache`](#gnutlsocspcache).

* The certificates must contain OCSP access URIs using HTTP so
  mod_gnutls can fetch responses, alternatively you may provide
  responses using [`GnuTLSOCSPResponseFile`](#gnutlsocspresponsefile).

If a server certificate contains the "must-staple" extension (X.509
TLS Feature extension defined in [RFC
7633](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7633)) and the configuration does
not support stapling mod_gnutls will refuse to start.

By default mod\_gnutls regularly refreshes the cached OCSP responses
in the background, see
[`GnuTLSOCSPAutoRefresh`](#gnutlsocspautorefresh) for details.

### GnuTLSOCSPStapling

Enable OCSP stapling for this (virtual) host.

    GnuTLSOCSPStapling [On|Off]

Default: *on* if requirements are met, *off* otherwise\
Context: server config, virtual host

Stapling is activated by default if the requirements [listed
above](#ocsp-stapling-configuration) are met.

If the server certificate requires stapling ("must-staple") or
`GnuTLSOCSPStapling` is explicitly set to `on` unmet requirements are
an error.

OCSP cache updates are serialized using the `gnutls-ocsp` mutex.

### GnuTLSOCSPCache

OCSP stapling cache configuration

	GnuTLSOCSPCache (shmcb|memcache|...|none)[:PARAMETERS]

Default: `shmcb:gnutls_ocsp_cache`\
Context: server config

This directive configures the OCSP stapling cache, and uses the same
syntax as [`GnuTLSCache`](#gnutlscache). Please check there for
details.

The default should be reasonable for most servers and requires
[mod\_socache\_shmcb](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/mod/mod_socache_shmcb.html)
to be loaded. Servers with very many virtual hosts may need to
increase the default cache size via the parameters string, those with
few virtual hosts and memory constraints could save a few KB by reducing
it. Note that `mod_socache_dbm` has a size constraint for entries that
is generally too small for OCSP responses.

If the selected cache implementation is not thread-safe, access
is serialized using the `gnutls-ocsp-cache` mutex.

### GnuTLSOCSPAutoRefresh

Regularly refresh cached OCSP responses independent of TLS handshakes?

    GnuTLSOCSPAutoRefresh [On|Off]

Default: *on*\
Context: server config, virtual host

By default `mod_gnutls` will regularly refresh the cached OCSP
responses, regardless of whether they are used. This has advantages
over updating OCSP responses only when a TLS handshake needs them:

* Handshakes are not delayed by updating the OCSP response cache
  first.

* Updating the cached response before it expires can hide short
  unavailability of the OCSP responder, if a repeated request is
  successful before the cache expires (see below).

The interval to the next request is determined as follows: After a
successful OCSP request the next one is scheduled for a random period
between `GnuTLSOCSPFuzzTime` and half of it before
`GnuTLSOCSPCacheTimeout` expires. For example, if the cache timeout is
3600 seconds and the fuzz time 600 seconds, the next request will be
sent after 3000 to 3300 seconds. If the validity period of the
response expires before then, the selected interval is halved until it
is smaller than the time until expiry. If an OCSP request fails, it is
retried after `GnuTLSOCSPFailureTimeout`.

Regularly updating the OCSP cache requires `mod_watchdog`,
`mod_gnutls` will fall back to updating the OCSP cache during
handshakes if `mod_watchdog` is not available or this option is set to
`Off`.

### GnuTLSOCSPCheckNonce

Send nonces in OCSP requests and verify them in responses.

    GnuTLSOCSPCheckNonce [On|Off]

Default: *off*\
Context: server config, virtual host

If `GnuTLSOCSPCheckNonce` is enabled, `mod_gnutls` will send nonces in
OCSP requests and verify them in responses. Responses without a nonce
or with a mismatching one will be considered invalid and discarded.

This option is disabled by default because many CAs do not support the
OCSP nonce extension. The likely reason for that is the use of
pre-produced responses, as described in [RFC 6960, Section
2.5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6960#section-2.5).

### GnuTLSOCSPResponseFile

Read OCSP responses for stapling from these files (one or more)
instead of sending a request over HTTP.

    GnuTLSOCSPResponseFile /path/to/response.der [...]

Default: *empty*\
Context: server config, virtual host

The first listed file must contain a response for the server
certificate, responses for intermediate CAs may be added in the order
they appear in [GnuTLSCertificateFile](#gnutlscertificatefile). You
can revert to the default fetch mechanism for a specific certificate
(including the server certificate) by giving the empty string (`""`)
instead of a file path.

The response files must be updated externally, for example using a
cron job. This option is an alternative to the server fetching OCSP
responses over HTTP. Reasons to use this option include:

* Performing OCSP requests separate from the web server (e.g. to share
  responses across a server cluster).
* The issuer CA uses an access method other than HTTP, or doesn't
  include an OCSP URL in the certificate.
* Testing

You can use a GnuTLS `ocsptool` command like the following to create
and update the response file:

    ocsptool --ask --nonce --load-issuer ca_cert.pem \
        --load-cert server_cert.pem --outfile ocsp_response.der

Additional error checking is highly recommended. You may have to
remove the `--nonce` option if the OCSP responder of your CA does not
support nonces.

### GnuTLSOCSPCacheTimeout

Cache timeout for OCSP responses

    GnuTLSOCSPCacheTimeout SECONDS

Default: *3600*\
Context: server config, virtual host

Cached OCSP responses will be refreshed after the configured number of
seconds. How long this timeout should reasonably be depends on your
CA, namely how often its OCSP responder is updated and how long
responses are valid. Note that a response will not be cached beyond
its lifetime as denoted in the `nextUpdate` field of the response.

### GnuTLSOCSPFailureTimeout

Wait this many seconds before retrying a failed OCSP request.

    GnuTLSOCSPFailureTimeout SECONDS

Default: *300*\
Context: server config, virtual host

Retries of failed OCSP requests must be rate limited to avoid
overloading both the server using mod_gnutls and the CA's OCSP
responder. A shorter value increases the load on both sides, a longer
one means that stapling will remain disabled for longer after a failed
request. The auto-refresh mechanism updates OCSP responses before they
expire and can cover short unavailability of OCSP responders, see
[`GnuTLSOCSPAutoRefresh`](#gnutlsocspautorefresh) for details.

### GnuTLSOCSPFuzzTime

Update the cached OCSP response up to this time before the cache expires

    GnuTLSOCSPFuzzTime SECONDS

Default: *larger of GnuTLSOCSPCacheTimeout / 8 and GnuTLSOCSPFailureTimeout \* 2*\
Context: server config, virtual host

Refreshing the cached response before it expires hides short OCSP
responder unavailability. See `GnuTLSOCSPAutoRefresh` for how this
value is used, using at least twice `GnuTLSOCSPFailureTimeout` is
recommended.

### GnuTLSOCSPSocketTimeout

Timeout for TCP sockets used to send OCSP requests

    GnuTLSOCSPFailureTimeout SECONDS

Default: *6*\
Context: server config, virtual host

Stalled OCSP requests must time out after a while to prevent stalling
the server too much. However, if the timeout is too short requests may
fail with a slow OCSP responder or high latency network
connection. This parameter allows you to adjust the timeout if
necessary.

Note that this is not an upper limit for the completion of an OCSP
request but a socket timeout. The connection will time out if there is
no activity (successful send or receive) at all for the configured
time.

Configuration Examples
======================

Minimal Example
---------------

A minimal server configuration using mod_gnutls might look like this
(other than the default setup):

```apache
# Load mod_gnutls into Apache.
LoadModule gnutls_module modules/mod_gnutls.so

Listen 192.0.2.1:443

<VirtualHost _default_:443>
	# Standard virtual host stuff
	DocumentRoot /www/site1.example.com/html
	ServerName site1.example.com:443

	# Minimal mod_gnutls setup: enable, and set credentials
	GnuTLSEnable on
	GnuTLSCertificateFile conf/tls/site1_cert_chain.pem
	GnuTLSKeyFile conf/tls/site1_key.pem
</VirtualHost>
```

This gives you an HTTPS site using the default set of cipher suites
(see [`GnuTLSPriorities`](#gnutlspriorities)). OCSP stapling will be
enabled if the server certificate contains an OCSP URI,
`conf/tls/site1_cert_chain.pem` contains the issuer certificate in
addition to the server's, and
[mod\_socache\_shmcb](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/mod/mod_socache_shmcb.html)
is loaded.

Virtual Hosts with Server Name Indication
-----------------------------------------

`mod_gnutls` supports Server Name Indication (SNI), as specified in
[RFC 6066, Section 3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6066#section-3).
This allows hosting many TLS websites with a single IP address, you
can just add virtual host configurations. All recent browsers support
this standard. Here is an example using SNI:

```apache
# Load the module into Apache.
LoadModule gnutls_module modules/mod_gnutls.so
# This example server uses session tickets, no cache.
GnuTLSSessionTickets on

# SNI allows hosting multiple sites using one IP address. This
# could also be 'Listen *:443', just like '*:80' is common for
# non-HTTPS
Listen 198.51.100.1:443

<VirtualHost _default_:443>
	GnuTLSEnable on
	DocumentRoot /www/site1.example.com/html
    ServerName site1.example.com:443
	GnuTLSCertificateFile conf/tls/site1.crt
	GnuTLSKeyFile conf/tls/site1.key
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost _default_:443>
	GnuTLSEnable on
	DocumentRoot /www/site2.example.com/html
	ServerName site2.example.com:443
	GnuTLSCertificateFile conf/tls/site2.crt
	GnuTLSKeyFile conf/tls/site2.key
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost _default_:443>
	GnuTLSEnable on

Virtual Hosts without SNI
-------------------------

If you need to support clients that do not use SNI, you have to use a
unique IP address/port combination for each virtual host. In this
example all virtual hosts use the default port for HTTPS (443) and
different IP addresses.

```apache
# Load the module into Apache.
LoadModule gnutls_module modules/mod_gnutls.so
# This example server uses a session cache.
GnuTLSCache dbm:/var/cache/www-tls-cache
GnuTLSCacheTimeout 1200

# Without SNI you need one IP Address per site. The IP addresses
# are listed separately for clarity, you could also use "Listen 443"
# to use that port on all available IP addresses.
Listen 192.0.2.1:443
Listen 192.0.2.2:443
Listen 192.0.2.3:443

<VirtualHost 192.0.2.1:443>
	GnuTLSEnable on
	GnuTLSPriorities SECURE128
	DocumentRoot /www/site1.example.com/html
	ServerName site1.example.com:443
	GnuTLSCertificateFile conf/tls/site1.crt
	GnuTLSKeyFile conf/tls/site1.key
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 192.0.2.2:443>
    # This virtual host enables SRP authentication
	GnuTLSEnable on
	GnuTLSPriorities NORMAL:+SRP
	DocumentRoot /www/site2.example.com/html
	ServerName site2.example.com:443
	GnuTLSSRPPasswdFile conf/tls/tpasswd.site2
	GnuTLSSRPPasswdConfFile conf/tls/tpasswd.site2.conf
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 192.0.2.3:443>
	# This server enables SRP and X.509 authentication.
	GnuTLSEnable on
	GnuTLSPriorities NORMAL:+SRP:+SRP-RSA:+SRP-DSS
	DocumentRoot /www/site3.example.com/html
	ServerName site3.example.com:443
	GnuTLSCertificateFile conf/tls/site3.crt
	GnuTLSKeyFile conf/tls/site3.key
	GnuTLSSRPPasswdFile conf/tls/tpasswd.site3
	GnuTLSSRPPasswdConfFile conf/tls/tpasswd.site3.conf
</VirtualHost>
```

OCSP Stapling Example
---------------------

This is an example with a customized OCSP stapling configuration. What
is a resonable cache timeout varies depending on how long your CA's
OCSP responses are valid. Some CAs provide responses that are valid
for multiple days, in that case timeout and fuzz time could be
significantly larger.

```apache
# Load the module into Apache.
LoadModule gnutls_module modules/mod_gnutls.so
# A 64K cache is more than enough for one response
GnuTLSOCSPCache shmcb:ocsp_cache(65536)

Listen 192.0.2.1:443

<VirtualHost _default_:443>
	GnuTLSEnable           On
	DocumentRoot           /www/site1.example.com/html
	ServerName             site1.example.com:443
	GnuTLSCertificateFile  conf/tls/site1_cert_chain.pem
	GnuTLSKeyFile          conf/tls/site1_key.pem
	GnuTLSOCSPStapling     On
	# The cached OCSP response is kept for up to 4 hours,
	# with updates scheduled every 3 to 3.5 hours.
	GnuTLSOCSPCacheTimeout 21600
	GnuTLSOCSPFuzzTime     3600
</VirtualHost>
```

Environment Variables
=====================

`mod_gnutls` exports the following environment variables to scripts.
These are compatible with `mod_ssl`.

`HTTPS`
-------

Can be `on` or `off`

`SSL_VERSION_LIBRARY`
---------------------

The version of the GnuTLS library

`SSL_VERSION_INTERFACE`
-----------------------

The version of this module

`SSL_PROTOCOL`
--------------

The SSL or TLS protocol name (such as `TLS 1.0` etc.)

`SSL_CIPHER`
------------

The SSL or TLS cipher suite name

`SSL_COMPRESS_METHOD`
---------------------

The negotiated compression method (`NULL` or `DEFLATE`)

`SSL_SRP_USER`
--------------

The SRP username used for authentication (only set when
`GnuTLSSRPPasswdFile` and `GnuTLSSRPPasswdConfFile` are configured).

`SSL_CIPHER_USEKEYSIZE` & `SSL_CIPHER_ALGKEYSIZE`
-------------------------------------------------

The number if bits used in the used cipher algorithm.

This does not fully reflect the security level since the size of
RSA or DHE key exchange parameters affect the security level too.

`SSL_DH_PRIME_BITS`
-------------------

The number if bits in the modulus for the DH group, if DHE or static
DH is used.

This will not be set if DH is not used.

`SSL_CIPHER_EXPORT`
-------------------

`True` or `False`. Whether the cipher suite negotiated is an export one.

`SSL_SESSION_ID`
----------------

The session ID negotiated in this session. Can be the same during client
reloads.

`SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY`
-------------------

Verification status of the client's certificate, if any. May be
`SUCCESS`, `FAILED` or `NONE`. See
[`GnuTLSClientVerify`](#gnutlsclientverify).

`SSL_CLIENT_V_REMAIN`
---------------------

The number of days until the client's certificate is expired.

`SSL_CLIENT_V_START`
--------------------

The activation time of client's certificate.

`SSL_CLIENT_V_END`
------------------

The expiration time of client's certificate.

`SSL_CLIENT_S_DN`
-----------------

The distinguished name of client's certificate in RFC2253 format.

`SSL_CLIENT_I_DN`
-----------------

The distinguished name of the issuer of the client's certificate in
RFC2253 format.

`SSL_CLIENT_S_AN%`
------------------

These will contain the alternative names of the client certificate (`%` is
a number starting from zero).

The values will be prepended by `DNSNAME:`, `RFC822NAME:` or `URI:`
depending on the type.

If it is not supported the value `UNSUPPORTED` will be set.

`SSL_SERVER_M_SERIAL`
---------------------

The serial number of the server's certificate.

`SSL_SERVER_M_VERSION`
----------------------

The version of the server's certificate.

`SSL_SERVER_A_SIG`
------------------

The algorithm used for the signature in server's certificate.

`SSL_SERVER_A_KEY`
------------------

The public key algorithm in server's certificate.

`SSL_SERVER_CERT`
------------------

The PEM-encoded (X.509) server certificate (see the
`GnuTLSExportCertificates` directive).

`SSL_SERVER_CERT_TYPE`
----------------------

The certificate type will be `X.509`.

`SSL_CLIENT_CERT`
------------------

PEM-encoded (X.509) client certificate, if any (see the
`GnuTLSExportCertificates` directive).

`SSL_CLIENT_CERT_TYPE`
----------------------

The certificate type will be `X.509`, if any.
